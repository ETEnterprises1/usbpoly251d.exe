add:Python extension for Visual Studio Code
A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported Python versions), providing access points for extensions to seamlessly integrate and offer support for IntelliSense (Pylance), debugging (Python Debugger), formatting, linting, code navigation, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

Support for vscode.dev
The Python extension does offer some support when running on vscode.dev (which includes github.dev). This includes partial IntelliSense for open files in the editor.

Installed extensions
The Python extension will automatically install the following extensions by default to provide the best Python development experience in VS Code:

Pylance - to provide performant Python language support
Python Debugger - to provide a seamless debug experience with debugpy
These extensions are optional dependencies, meaning the Python extension will remain fully functional if they fail to be installed. Any or all of these extensions can be disabled or uninstalled at the expense of some features. Extensions installed through the marketplace are subject to the Marketplace Terms of Use.

Extensibility
The Python extension provides pluggable access points for extensions that extend various feature areas to further improve your Python development experience. These extensions are all optional and depend on your project configuration and preferences.

Python formatters
Python linters
If you encounter issues with any of the listed extensions, please file an issue in its corresponding repo.

Quick start
Step 1. Install a supported version of Python on your system (note: that the system install of Python on macOS is not supported).
Step 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.
Step 3. Open or create a Python file and start coding!
Set up your environment
Select your Python interpreter by clicking on the status bar


Configure the debugger through the Debug Activity Bar


Configure tests by running the Configure Tests command


Jupyter Notebook quick start
The Python extension offers support for Jupyter notebooks via the Jupyter extension to provide you a great Python notebook experience in VS Code.

Install the Jupyter extension.

Open or create a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and start coding in our Notebook Editor!
